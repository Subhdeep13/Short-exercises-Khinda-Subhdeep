    <p>
      New York Times columnist and author, Andrew Ross Sorkin, has been described as
      “the most famous financial journalist of his generation.” A leading voice on Wall Street and corporate
      America, his New York Times bestseller, <em>Too Big to Fail</em>, was the first, behind-the-scenes,
      moment-by-moment account of how that financial crisis developed into a global tsunami.

    <p>
      The book inspired the HBO film of the same name, and Sorkin’s work earned <em>Too Big to Fail</em>
      one of the best book of the year titles. The book was published by Viking October 20, 2009. 
      The book was adapted as a movie by HBO Films and premiered on HBO on May 23, 2011. The film was directed by Curtis Hanson,
      and the screenplay was written by Peter Gould.
